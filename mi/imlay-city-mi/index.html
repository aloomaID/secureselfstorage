            <h3>Imlay City, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Imlay City was founded on April 1, 1850, by Charles Palmer, the chief engineer of the Port Huron and Lake Michigan Railroad, who bought 240 acres of land along the railroad's route at a location Palmer anticipated would be a likely produce center between the towns of Capac and Lapeer. Palmer named the city for the Hartford, Connecticut-based capitalist William Henry Imlay (d. 4 Sep 1858), who had invested heavily in the area's natural resources after moving there in 1828. Within a year and a half, the newly established city had attracted 500 residents with over 120 buildings including two hotels, 20 stores, a sawmill, and a school.</p>
