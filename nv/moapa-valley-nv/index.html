            <h3>Moapa Valley, NV Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The Muddy River, formerly called the Moapa River, originates from the Warm Springs Natural Area and flows through the valley before emptying into Lake Mead. The communities of Moapa Town, Logandale and Overton are located in the valley. Logandale is about 12 miles (19 km) southeast of Moapa Town, and Overton is about 5 miles (8.0 km) southeast of Logandale. Prior to the creation of Lake Mead, Moapa Valley also included the town of St. Thomas, which was abandoned in 1938 due to the rising lake level.</p>
